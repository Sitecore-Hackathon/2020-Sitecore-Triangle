# Sitecore Triangle

Sitecore Hackathon 2020 entry by Team **Sitecore Triangle**

Topic: **Sitecore Hackathon Website – This idea is sooo meta! Several years have passed with the current version and it’s in need of a refresh.**

The **Sitecore Triangle** team picked-up the above mentioned topic and used following products/technologies:

* **[Sitecore Experience Accelerator](https://doc.sitecore.com/users/sxa/17/sitecore-experience-accelerator/en/introducing-sitecore-experience-accelerator.html)**
* Bootstrap 4
* ASP.NET MVC

## Module Purpose
Current **Sitecore Hackathon Website** is not very user interactive and not easy to maintain. The idea here is to use **[Sitecore Experience Accelerator](https://doc.sitecore.com/users/sxa/17/sitecore-experience-accelerator/en/introducing-sitecore-experience-accelerator.html)** module to:
* Help content teams create, edit, and deploy web content across channels in less time
* Easily change page components using drag-and-drop functionality
* Enjoy a CMS with WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editing
* Reuse pre-built components, templates, and layouts
* Quickly get your websites up and running
* Greatly reduce the time needed for custom development
#### Features include:
* Sample Site
* **Home Page** will provide:
    * Promo/Hero Banner: Content Author can setup rich content
    * Listing of Last 03 Hackathon events
* Content Author can create Judge details (rich text) for every year Hackathon event
* Content Author can manage the Hero banner/Promo Content for the Home Page
* End User can submit the Hackathon registration request via **Hackathon Registration Form**
* **Hackathon Registration Form** having time limit validation for Hackathon registration and after that user will see the custom message and this message can be setup by the Content Author
* Once **Hackathon Registration Form** submitted by the End user then Thank You message would be visible to user and this message can be setup by the Content Author
* After submission of **Hackathon Registration Form** team details would be stored in the **MASTER DB** with this Content Author/Admin can review the content and publish after validaiton to **WEB DB**
* End user can view listing of **Hackathon's**
* Each year **Hackathon** will provide:
    * Hackathon Details: Content Author can setup rich content
    * Listing of Teams participating in Hackathon
    * Listing of Judge details (rich text) in Hackathon

#### Limitations:
* No valiation on Form fields
* All fields are mandatory currently
* No autmation on publishing
* No registration confirmation email
* No Personalization
* Currently each Hackathon page displaying listing of Year 2020 Participants only, and this can be avoided by creating custom query and use in the PageList component
* Site User Interface: We have tried our best to on UI part but can't compete with UI developer :)
